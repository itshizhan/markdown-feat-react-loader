Hello, I have written awesome component, called Simply. Look at him.

```js{render}
<Simply />
```

And after element, we will continue to write story.

```js{render}
<Wrapper>
  # Title 1
  # Title 2

  But keep in the **mind**, that wrapped text by JSX *will* not be parsed by markdown
</Wrapper>
```


```js
Native code
```

`Inline code`

```js{+render}
<Simply />
```
